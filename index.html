                 <p class="primary-p">Samburu National Reserve is located in Samburu County, on the banks of the Ewaso Ngiro River, pretty much slap bang in the centre of Kenya.

                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>If your venturing up to Central or Northern Kenya, Samburu National Reserve is a wonderful place to visit. Its very beautiful, a little off the beaten path and was actually the very first safari I ever did in Africa.</li>
                    <li>Samburu and the nearby parks have whats known as the Special 5 the gerenuk, reticulated giraffe, Grevys zebra, Somali ostrich and the beisa oryx, as well as plenty of elephants!</li>
                    <li>So is Samburu National Reserve worth visiting? Definitely, as youll see animals here that you wont see elsewhere and its much less crowded than other Kenyan safari destinations.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p class="primary-p">Samburu National Reserve is not as well-known as some of Kenyas other parks, such as the Masai Mara or Tsavo National Park, but it has several animal species that are unique to that specific area, making it a very interesting place to visit.</p>
